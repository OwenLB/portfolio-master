## BACKGROUND

The project involved creating a 3D model of an Airbnb concept using 3D spline modeling software. The main objective was to test the capabilities of this tool and explore the possibilities offered by three-dimensional design. The model was intended to visually represent a simplified version of the Airbnb platform. The project provided an opportunity to test 3D modeling skills and deepen understanding of design concepts related to user interface and user experience.
