## Background and Goals

# Presentation of the Design Studio:
Imagine a fictional design studio specializing in interior design, distinguished by its creativity and exceptional know-how in creating inspiring spaces. Committed to offering an immersive digital experience from the very first contact, the studio wishes to highlight its expertise in fluid, engaging animations. The "Animated Loader for a Landing Page" project was designed to reflect the studio's modern aesthetic and originality, while captivating visitors' attention as they wait for the page to fully load.

# Project goal:
The main objective was to design an original and aesthetically appealing loader to reinforce the studio's brand image and arouse the curiosity of users waiting for the page to load completely.

## Design and Creation

# Choice of Technology:
The loader was developed using the React library for its flexibility and popularity in the creation of interactive web applications. Framer Motion was selected for its potential to create dynamic, responsive animations.

# Inspiration research:
Before starting the design, a thorough search for inspiration was carried out, exploring examples of creative and original loaders. This helped define a clear vision of the loader to be designed.

# Prototyping:
Several prototypes were created and tested to fine-tune animations, timing and interactions.

## Loader features

# Loader animation:
The loader begins with a fluid entry animation that attracts the user's attention. Loader elements appear progressively with fade-in effects, and the main image takes its place on the landing page.

# Landing page animations:
As the page loads, landing page elements appear progressively with fading and moving effects. A main image appears, while the main text is displayed letter by letter, then scrolls elegantly.

## Results and learnings

# Results:
The animated loader was integrated into the design studio's fictitious landing page. It received positive feedback during my portfolio presentations, highlighting its visual impact and originality.
What I learned: This project gave me a better understanding of the possibilities offered by Framer Motion for creating complex, interactive animations. I also strengthened my skills in integrating animations into React projects.

# Conclusion:
The "Animated Loader for a Landing Page" project was an opportunity to explore animations with Framer Motion while showcasing my front-end development skills. This captivating loader helps present the fictional design studio as a creative and innovative player in the industry, while creating a memorable user experience from the very first moments.
