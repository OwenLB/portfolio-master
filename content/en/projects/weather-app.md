## BACKGROUND

The weather application we developed in Master 2 was an evaluation project using the Flutter framework. Our main objective was to create a user-friendly and intuitive interface to give users easy access to weather forecasts. Using Flutter, we were able to develop a cross-platform application compatible with both Android and iOS, using a single code. We integrated a reliable weather API to obtain the necessary data, and added features such as city search, multi-day forecasts and graphs to visualize temperature variations.

During the development process, we paid particular attention to optimizing the application's performance. We ensured that it ran smoothly and responsively, even with large volumes of weather data. In addition, we ensured that the user interface was attractive and easy to use, guaranteeing a pleasant experience for users.

In conclusion, our Flutter evaluation project in Master 2 enabled us to put our mobile application development skills into practice. We created a functional weather application, offering accurate weather forecasts and easy access for users. Thanks to Flutter, we were able to develop an effective cross-platform application, using a single source code for both Android and iOS platforms. The project also enabled us to gain valuable experience in using Flutter and to strengthen our expertise in mobile app development.
