## SAFEWALK

Safe Walk is an association dedicated to improving safety on the streets.
It's a movement that began in Rennes several weeks ago and is gaining momentum. The idea is to enable those who wish to do so to find someone to walk them home when they are alone at night, or when they feel in danger. In other words, to get together and take the fear out of being on the streets.
Safe Walk has now been extended to the city of Brest, thanks to the goodwill of two women, Eva and Amandine.
Their aim is to reduce the rate of aggression in the city, which has been rising steadily over the past few years.

## BACKGROUND

Today, Safe Walk is present only on social networks, in particular Facebook. It can be accessed via various groups on this network. For example, there is a SafeWalk-Rennes group and a SafeWalk-Brest group.

First of all, you need to access the group bearing the name of the city in which you're staying, of course.
There is then a waiting period until an administrator authorizes your entry into the group. Your identity will need to be verified. Safe Walk advocates safety for all.
Once registered, group members are divided geographically. If a member wishes to go out or come back from an evening out accompanied, he or she lets us know, and those in the vicinity make themselves known and meet up.

Safe Walk is a fast-growing movement, with 18 regions in France now having their own escort groups.
But more and more people are taking an interest. This is why Safe Walk would like to implement a more practical means of facilitating exchanges between companions and escorts, which would require less work on the part of Safe Walk members.

## THE PROJECT

The project is really about spreading SafeWalk to as many people as possible. But that's not all.
Indeed, by presenting an application project, SafeWalk is more legitimate to ask for subsidies or investments, whereas a Facebook group or a discord server can seem rather insubstantial.
The aim was to have a working cross-platform application by summer 2022.

So we had 7 weeks to :

- Study the requirements
- Write the specifications
- Produce mock-ups
- Create the prototype
- Create the MVP
- Produce documentation
