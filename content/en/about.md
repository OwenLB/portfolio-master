Welcome to my website!

Ever since my first steps on the family computer playing Minecraft, my passion for development has taken root. From graphic design to my first steps in coding in high school, my path has taken me from blogging in PHP to the exciting world of web development.

After a DUT in Computer Science in Lannion, a degree in Computer Engineering in Brest, and a Master's in full-stack web and mobile development in Corte, each step strengthened my skills. My experience at Safe Walk, designing an application with Ionic and Angular, illustrates my ability to apply my knowledge to real-life projects.

As a work-study student at Crédit Mutuel Arkéa, I took part in various projects, from banking to real estate, creating proofs of concept and tackling stimulating technical challenges.

After this rewarding experience, I joined Thales on a permanent contract, starting with a project for Naval Group. I worked on a task scheduler for the workshops, providing technical solutions to optimize the management and organization of activities. This assignment enabled me to strengthen my development expertise while working in a demanding industrial environment.
