GPT Chat: Of course, I can help you write the text for your website. Here's a suggestion:

Welcome to my website!

From my first steps on the family computer, where I spent hours playing Minecraft, my passion for development began to take shape. I quickly created small mods to enhance my gaming experience, and then discovered the exciting world of graphic design.

As I approached high school, I decided to pursue a career as a graphic designer. To feed my thirst for knowledge, I chose the Computer Science and Digital Science (ISN) option in seconde. This was my first introduction to development and coding.

In the final year of high school, I continued my studies by choosing the ISN speciality. I then created my first website, a blog in PHP. This experience opened my eyes to the infinite potential of web development and encouraged me to pursue my studies in this field.

So I enrolled for a DUT in Computer Science at Lannion, where I learned the basics of development, including languages such as C, Java, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as well as algorithms and object-oriented programming.

During my DUT internship, I had the opportunity to work as a front-end developer. I contributed to the graphic redesign of their SEO tool, writing a detailed style guide. This experience enabled me to consolidate my skills and become more familiar with the professional world.

I then went on to study for a degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Brest. This enabled me to consolidate my skills and specialize further in web development.

During my bachelor's degree, I did an internship with the Safe Walk association, which offers a co-pedestrian service to help people get around safely at night. I was in charge of drawing up the specifications, designing a functional model and initiating the development of an application using Ionic and Angular technologies. This experience gave me the opportunity to work on a concrete project and apply my web and mobile development skills.

To perfect my knowledge and acquire new skills, I decided to continue my studies by joining a Master's program in full-stack web and mobile development in Corte, Corsica. This program enabled me to familiarize myself with the latest technologies and specialize in web and mobile development.

Alongside my studies, I had the chance to work on a sandwich course at Crédit Mutuel Arkéa as a full-stack web developer. I was involved in a number of projects, covering fields as varied as banking, insurance and real estate. I was able to put my skills into practice by carrying out proofs of concept (POC) and tackling challenging technical subjects.
